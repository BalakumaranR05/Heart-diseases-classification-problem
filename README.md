EDA and Model is build on the data collected from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+Disease.

Classification is done by building three Machine learning models Logistic Regression, K Nearest Neighbors and RandomForest Classifier, but futher hyperparameter tuning is done on all Models using RandomizedSearchCV and GridSearchCV to achieve best possible accuracy.
